# Blockwalk




# General
This is a plugin that adds a command to your server, the `/blockwalk` command. If you do this command you can walk around your world and every block you walk over wil change in a redstone block. (Currently I am making you can choose which block it changes to.)

If you want to activate the Blockwalk, you need to do `/blockwalk` and it will say activated, now you can walk around and have fun!

To deactivate it do `/blockwalk` again, and it will deactivate, and it will say Deactivated!


This plugin is very useful if you want to make way to your house.
Or you can walk over water.

Also its is very fun to use!



# Important

If you have a server with less CPU power the server can begin to lagg.

But the most servers will run it perfectly!

# ToDo

1. Making you choose what will be the new block under your feet.
2. Allow you to choose which blocks to exclude from changing. (e.g. air)
3. Creating a permission, if you don't have that permission you can't run blockwalk.
